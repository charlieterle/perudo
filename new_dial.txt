Observations with regard to new simulation data:

CURRENT PLAYER : WHOLE TABLE

When the current player has 1 die, the dudo success rate is 100%. Always.

Current player dice count: 2 -> actual success rate is about .2 lower for
the majority of play situations

Dice count 3 -> actual success rate is more like .15 lower than predicted
success rate, except with very low dice ratios, then it's more like .2

dice count 5 -> actual success rate close to predicted success rate, unless
dice ratio is low (i.e. beginning of game). Also low actual success rate if
the player has a very high dice ratio (i.e. end of game, only 2 players
remaining.)



PREVIOUS PLAYER : WHOLE TABLE

When the previous player has 1 die, the dudo success rate is on average
about .05 above the predicted rate. Dudo success rate is very high at
extremely low dice ratios, which isn't surprising.

Previous player dice count: 2 -> Actual success is quite close to predicted
success, except at low ratios, where dudo is much less successful. This is
because the low ratios mean that there are still lots of dice left, and the
people calling dudo therefore don't know as much as they would if the total
dice count were lower.

Dice count 3: Same as dice count 2

Dice count 5: Same as dice count 3



INTER PLAYER RATIO
(Offensive : Defensive)

Dudo is clearly more successful when the defensive player has fewer dice,
and less successful when the defensive player has more dice. Unless the
offensive player has 1 die.

By using all dice counts except for (offense: 1), a rather linear-looking
relationship appears. for the ratio .4, dudo success is .38, and for the
ratio 5, dudo success is .8. Therefore, the relationship is
P(dudo success) =
