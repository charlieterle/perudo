# perudo

Implementation of the dice game Perudo (AKA Liar's Dice), along with a game simulator and other files


Please read the .txt files for a explanations of the game rules and the probability calculations used in the source code

As of August 6 2020, the source code files include:

perudo.py - gameplay definitions

move_probability.py - computes and prints the probability of success of all possible moves on a given turn of Perudo

simulation.py - simulates multiple games of Perudo using all computer players, and calculates/prints statistics on the games


I am planning to include the following updates at a later date:

play.py - a file that will allow the user to play against computers

update to dudo_dial - this feature is currently implemented to calculate probability of dudo calls, but it doesn't work well in all situations
